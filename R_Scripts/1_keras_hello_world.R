#
# A basic 'hello world' example to test your Keras+TensorFlow install.
#
# Throughout this course - we'll save features as 'X', and classes
# as 'Y'. So x_train are features of training samples and y_train are
# matching 'ground truth labels for the species of Iris the sample is.
#
# Iris Data Set: Iris data set is built into R
# Comprised of 3 different Iris species (50 samples each as rows)
# Each flower has 4 features, width and height of sepals and petals
# Features are in the first for cols, flower "class" label is final col
# Challenge: Prediction performance is not so great - can you modify
# the model to get better performance?
