## R-version of Keras Scripts

In order to use these scripts you will first need to install the `keras` package. Afterwards, you need to start R and load the library before running the following function: `install_keras()`

This will use the `reticulate` package (this interfaces R with Python code) to install `tensorflow` in the background for use. Without this installation the code will not work!
