# Original Paper Concept from: S. Rajaraman et al. PeerJ 6:e4568, 2018.
# Some code modified from: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/12/03/deep-learning-and-medical-image-analysis-with-keras/
# R-code adjustments from: https://keras.rstudio.com
#
# Here we're going to perform 'transfer learning', borrowing from a pre-trained model 'MobileNet' and using
# is to learn a new classifier for images of malaria parasitized vs uninfected cells.
#
# On a laptop this code is probably best for just learning the basic concept of using pre-trained models and image
# generators- you'd really need to run this on a cluster to process images enough to get a decent classifier. 
#
# !NOTE: You will need to set the 'train_img_location' and 'test_img_location' paths to the dataset
# !NOTE: You will likely need to install the Python package 'Pillow' to make this run properly with images.
# !Mac OSX NOTE: I needed to install the Python package 'nomkl' to prevent OpenMPI from crashing
#
# Malaria Dataset (source: https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/proj/malaria/cell_images.zip)
# The full-size dataset contains about 50K parasitized/uninfected cells for training and 10K for testing.
# Images are variable size PNGs (around ~250x250px) in RGB color.
