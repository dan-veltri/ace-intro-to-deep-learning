#
# Here we're going to use a convolutional neural network (CNN)- specifically an
# 2D CNN to try and predict if images from the CIFAR10 dataset belong to one of
# ten classes/categories. For more details on Keras' CNN implementation see:
# https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/
# The problems we need to solve to use our CNN are:
# 1) How do we 'massage' our image data and responses so that it fits into our network?
# 	- We'll have to do some reshaping first!
#	
# 2) Parameters - How good of performance can you get?
# 	- Try adjusting the number of epochs, filters and kernal sizes 
#	
# The CIFAR10 Data: Keras comes with a pre-processed training/testing data set (cifar10) that
# includes 50,000 32x32 color (RGB) images labeled as one of ten classes. Load the data as follow:
#  (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()
#  x_train and x_test are arrays containing RGB images (num_samples, 3, 32, 32)
#  y_train and y_test contain arrays of corresponding category numbers (0-9)
#
# More dataset details available in: https://keras.io/datasets/
#
# Challenge:  Can you add additional Conv and pooling layers to the model and improve the ACC?
