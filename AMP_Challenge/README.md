## AMP Deep Learning Challenge!

You're now a little familiar with AMPs but up until now you have been working with physicochemical features. Here is a chance to try predicting using just the raw peptide amino acid sequences using the new deep learning tools you have learned!


### Instructions
I will give you a starting template along with training and validation set to get started (I've given you a function to load in the sequences already). Try to build a Keras model that performs as best as you can get on the validation set.

After some time I will post up a final testing set and we'll see which model performs the best!
